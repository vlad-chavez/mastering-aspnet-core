## ‚úçÔ∏è My Learning Process (Human Input)

My human contribution to this repository is the act of **prompting the AI** to generate and adapt learning materials (notes and project outlines) that align with the structure of the course cited above. My personal study involves:
1.  **Verification:** Fact-checking all core claims in the notes.
2.  **Elaboration:** Adding my own detailed, human-written summaries and supplementary examples.

The original prompts used to generate the roadmap content can be found in **`PROMPTS.md`**.
